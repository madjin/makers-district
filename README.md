# makers-district

[Makers District](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/neighborhoods/makers) is a place for people interested in DIY, hardware, IOT, 3D printing, hackerspaces, robotics, and electronics. The district was born around September 2018 in Origin City of Cryptovoxels, a virtual world built on the ethereum blockchain. Come join our community of builders, makers, artists, VR devs, and hobbyists that enjoy tinkering and collaborating on open source software.
